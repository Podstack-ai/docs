## Sign Up Process

### Step 1: Visit the Portal

Navigate to the Podstack customer portal and click **Get Started** or **Sign In**.

Enter your email address in the login form. If you're a new user, an account will be created automatically.

### Step 3: Verify with OTP

1. Check your email for a 6-digit verification code
2. The code expires in **10 minutes**
3. Enter the code in the verification form
4. Click **Verify** to complete authentication

### Step 4: Access Your Dashboard

After successful verification, you'll be redirected to your dashboard where you can:

- Deploy resources
- Manage settings

## Logging In

Returning users follow the same process:

1. Enter your registered email address
2. Receive OTP via email
3. Enter the code to access your account

## Session Management

- Your session remains active until you log out

## Accepting Project Invitations

If you've been invited to join a team project:

1. Check your email for the invitation

4. You'll be added to the project with assigned permissions

## Troubleshooting

**Not receiving OTP emails?**
