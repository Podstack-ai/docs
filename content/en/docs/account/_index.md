## Security

### Authentication

Podstack uses passwordless authentication:

- No passwords to remember or manage
- Secure, phishing-resistant

### Session Management

- Sessions remain active until logout
- Tokens auto-refresh for seamless access
- Logout from header menu to end session

### API Security

- API tokens have configurable expiration
- Tokens can be revoked at any time
- Use separate tokens for different integrations
